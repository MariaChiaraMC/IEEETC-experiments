XOR-AND Graphs (XAGs) are an enrichment of the classical Add Inverted Graphs (AIGs) with XOR nodes. In particular,  XAGs are networks composed by ANDs, XORs, and inverters. Besides several emerging technologies applications, XAGs are often exploited in cryptography-related applications based on the multiplicative complexity of a Boolean function. The multiplicative complexity of a function is  the minimum number of  AND gates (i.e., multiplications) that are sufficient to represent the function over the basis  \{AND, XOR, NOT\}. In fact, the minimization of the number of AND gates is  important for high-level cryptography protocols such as secure multiparty computation, where  processing AND gates is more expensive than processing XOR gates. Moreover, it is an indicator of the degree of vulnerability of the circuit, as a small number of AND gates corresponds to a high vulnerability to algebraic attacks. 

In this experiments we apply the autosymmetry and D-Reducibility properties and the mockturtle minimization tool to some Boolean functions, highlighting as the minimization tool reaches best resuls in most cases (namely, final functions with less AND gates) w.r.t. when the studied properties are not exploited.
